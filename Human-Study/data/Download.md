# Downloading `RAW` data

A cleanup version of human study data is available as a CSV file. For those interested in diving deeper, we also release the raw data (taken directly from the Gorilla website) and the code to process them.

Please download the `raw_data.zip` file from [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1N1l-ojQPN6tvt9UG84qnCJHkQA_hZmIt/view?usp=sharing) and extract it in the same directory as this file.
